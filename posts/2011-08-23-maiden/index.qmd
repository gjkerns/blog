-   **What:** I want this blog to be about statistics, plain and sample. No frills, no tomfoolery, just bare-boned statistics from beginning to end. Plus Emacs, ESS, Org-Mode, and R, but that goes without saying.

-   **When:** I've wanted to do this for a long time, but had as of yet convinced myself that I didn't have time for it. A sabbatical coupled with the renewed energy of a [use R! conference](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/) can change things considerably.

-   **How:** Emacs + Org mode + Jekyll + Github = Blog + R! After much fiddling and googling I have managed to figure out how to run a blog entirely through Emacs and Git. If you'd like to do the same I recommend reading [here](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html) and [here](http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/), with liberal doses of [this](http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/) and [that](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Ultimately, if you'd like to know how I do it then you can find the org-mode source code for this blog [here](https://github.com/gjkerns/blog) and you can download the final result [here](https://github.com/gjkerns/gjkerns.github.com) (which still is source code but is as close to final as possible).

The bottom line: with this setup I can effortlessly do R code like this:

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

And can include plots like this:

```{r}
#| label: fig-skiddaw
#| fig-cap: A plot to get things started.
#| warning: false
x = rnorm(100) 
y = rnorm(100)
plot(y ~ x)
```

all housed inside a simple, dynamic text file that I can edit with [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and can version-control with [git](http://git-scm.com/). On top of all this, I get LaTeX formatting in HTML via [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). Life is good.
