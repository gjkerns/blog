No frills, no tomfoolery, just bare-boned statistics from beginning to end. Plus Emacs, ESS, Org-Mode, and R, but that goes without saying.\n\n-   **When:** I've wanted to do this for a long time, but had as of yet convinced myself that I didn't have time for it. A sabbatical coupled with the renewed energy of a [use R! conference](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/) can change things considerably.\n\n-   **How:** Emacs + Org mode + Jekyll + Github = Blog + R! After much fiddling and googling I have managed to figure out how to run a blog entirely through Emacs and Git. If you'd like to do the same I recommend reading [here](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html) and [here](http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/), with liberal doses of [this](http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/) and [that](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Ultimately, if you'd like to know how I do it then you can find the org-mode source code for this blog [here](https://github.com/gjkerns/blog) and you can download the final result [here](https://github.com/gjkerns/gjkerns.github.com) (which still is source code but is as close to final as possible).\n\nThe bottom line: with this setup I can effortlessly do R code like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrnorm(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] -0.8417498  1.5661733  1.4517939  0.8075502 -1.3006587  1.4853693\n [7]  0.0157239  1.1162398  1.4359540 -1.3781027\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd can include plots like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx = rnorm(100) \ny = rnorm(100)\nplot(y ~ x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A plot to get things started.](index_files/figure-html/fig-skiddaw-1.png){#fig-skiddaw width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nall housed inside a simple, dynamic text file that I can edit with [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and can version-control with [git](http://git-scm.com/). On top of all this, I get LaTeX formatting in HTML via [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). Life is good.\n",
